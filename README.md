Hello, my name is Lucas and I am currently a senior here at MSU and I expect to graduate next spring. I am really excited for the software construction course because I want to become a software engineer and being able to learn and use the tools necessary for a software engineering position will help bolster my way to this goal. Lets hope for a great semester!
